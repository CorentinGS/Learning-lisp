# Learning-lisp

As I'm learning lisp (Common Lisp), I'll share my code there. Feel free to improve it !

___

## Learning Process

1. My first step is to read __The Little Schemer__ by *Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen *
2. Then, I might read __Practical Common Lisp__ by *Peter Seibel*

## My Setup

``` common-lisp
(defun distro ()
    (quote("Arch Linux")))
```

``` common-lisp
(defun editor()
    (quote((+ "Doom Emacs" "Slime"))))
```
